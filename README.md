### Editor AR
This work describes a framework for modeling and executing training in augmented and virtual reality environments. The framework was designed based on characteristics observed in existing training applications for complex tasks, such as the use of tools, control panels and the need for step-by-step instructions. Unlike other frameworks, in the proposed system, it is possible to create the training entirely within the virtual/augmented environment, avoiding constant switching between 2D and 3D environments. The framework allows for the definition of steps in a training program, each of which includes textual instructions, videos, and 3D objects, static or animated, anchored in the real world. To demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, a training program for operating a Universal Testing Machine was created as a case study. Overall, the proposed framework allows for the creation of effective and efficient AR training programs for a variety of tasks and industries.

### Video Respiratory Monitor (Best paper of COMPSAC 2025)

This study aimed to assess the synchronization between a new respiratory video-based motion monitor and the spontaneous breathing of premature infants on noninvasive mechanical ventilation. The experimental setup involved placing a tag on the infant’s chest and abdomen, capturing their breathing with a camera, and comparing the video data with the ventilator's readings. The video monitor proved more accurate than the respirator, detecting 93.3% of respiratory movements versus 73.2% by the respirator. The video also detected the onset of breathing earlier than the respirator. The video monitor showed good precision and potential clinical benefits for premature infants, offering a noninvasive, cost-effective alternative for respiratory monitoring. Further studies are needed to refine its performance in various settings.

### Anatomy VR
This VR application allows users to explore and interact with a 3D human body in an immersive and educational environment. The user can toggle the visibility of different body systems and individual organs, enabling a layered understanding of human anatomy. This feature helps learners focus on specific structures, such as the skeletal, muscular, or circulatory systems, by isolating or combining them as needed.

In addition to passive visualization, the application includes an interactive room where users engage in a game-like activity: placing organs in their correct anatomical positions. Using VR controllers, users can grab organs and attempt to fit them into the appropriate location within a virtual body model. This hands-on approach reinforces learning through spatial awareness and active participation, making it a valuable tool for education, training, and engagement in anatomy-related fields.

### Exergames for Elderly People
Epidemiological studies suggest that engaging in activities like studying, working, and leisure throughout life helps build cognitive reserve, a form of brain resilience that may reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease. This study investigated the effects of neurorehabilitation using video games controlled by body movements on elderly women with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), grouped by educational level. Over 12 weeks, participants underwent cognitive training or took part in psychoeducational sessions (control). Results showed significant memory improvements in those with primary education, some gains in those with secondary education, and no changes in those with higher education. The findings highlight how cognitive training through interactive video games can especially benefit individuals with lower educational backgrounds, potentially aligning their cognitive performance with those of higher-educated peers, driven by neuroplasticity and the motivational aspect of learning in old age.

### Evaluation of Selection Techniques on a Mobile Augmented Reality Game
Selection is one of the most fundamental tasks performed by humans. In Virtual Reality (VR), a number of interaction techniques have been proposed to deal with this type of task. They can be based on different metaphors, that define how the interaction is performed. However, it is still not clear how these different metaphors perform under Augmented Reality (AR). We performed two experiments to evaluate two of those interaction techniques. One was based on a pointing metaphor, and the other on a surface interaction metaphor. To achieve this result, a game prototype was developed, where users had to apply the selection techniques to reach a goal and win. We evaluated the impact of two different types of devices and two types of crowd simulation (with and without flocking behavior) in the user interaction. The scenario allowed the user to easily navigate around the scene from an overview perspective.

### Music Game
The goal of this project was to develop a game used in the PUCRS 2016 Games Concert, where the orchestra has performed a number of game themes. The aim of the game was to swing a virtual baton on the screen, hitting jumping objects. The conductor's baton was fitted with a Polhemus Fastrak 3D magnetic tracker, in order to realistically provide the virtual baton movements. Additionally, the computer microphone was used to capture the orchestra music in real time, generating the jumping objects according to the music beats.

### EGO-EXO: A Cooperative Manipulation Technique with Automatic Viewpoint Control
Cooperative manipulation techniques allow multiple users to interact with an object together at the same time. This kind of collaboration allow users to solve complex tasks that would be difficult for a single user to perform. The EGOEXO technique proposed in this paper places two collaborating users in asymmetric viewpoint positions. It was developed from the premise that simultaneous control over navigation and manipulation by the user can increase the interaction complexity. Our technique allows one of the users to follow the object being manipulated automatically while the other stays in a fixed position farther away. Our technique separates the degrees of freedom between the two users, matching the degrees to the most suitable viewpoints. Each user interacts with objects using complimentary manipulation techniques, which were chosen based on which degrees they control.

### Usage of tactile feedback to assist cooperative object manipulations in virtual environments
The objective of this work is to study the conversion process from the depth information that is acquired from a real scene, into a tactile representation, through the use of a haptic display. The intent is to obtain useful knowledge to support the creation of tools targeted to assist visually impaired subjects, during their navigation tasks, more especially when the path have a significant number of large obstacles along its way.

### SculptAR: An Augmented Reality Interaction System
SculptAR is a system created for the interaction of users and virtual objects to build art sculptures using augmented reality. It can be used with any device equipped with a camera to display a virtual environment on its screen, where the user can interact by tapping on the display. SculptAR bases itself on AR markers in order to provide a physical reference of the real space where the virtual environment is going to be created. There are three different sets of markers that define which type of sculpture can be created: the Particle System mode, composed of smoke, spark, spray and flare particles, which allows parameter modifications; a Palm Tree mode, with LEGO-like blocks to build a palm tree; and the Fried Sculpture mode to create a Fried sculpture.

The interface is designed to be simple and consistent in a way that there is a general flow of actions: the user selects a tool, aims at an object with a pointer and taps the screen to perform the operation.

### Evaluating the Use of Virtual Reality on Professional Robotics Education
This work consists of the study of techniques of robotics and virtual reality to develop a simulator that can be used in robotics schools, having an adequate visualization and a simple and intuitive way of interaction. For this, a 3D virtual environment for robotics was developed. Virtual reality resources have been incorporated to improve the visualization and to facilitate the user interaction with the environment. In order to evaluate the effectivity of the environment, user experiments were carried out on four different hardware configurations. During the simulations, the users had to create trajectories while implicitly defining reference points. From these experiments, automatic reports for the quantitative questions were generated, and questionnaires were filled for the qualitative questions. The results have shown that the use of virtual reality do helps the users in task execution, improving the visualization, reducing the time spent for the tasks and increasing the precision.
